//! The architectural abstraction layer.
//!
//! This module defines the `Arch` trait, which encapsulates all
//! architecture-specific functionality required by the kernel. To port the
//! kernel to a new architecture, a new submodule must be created here which
//! implements this trait.
//!
//! The rest of the kernel should use the `ArchImpl` type alias to access
//! architecture-specific functions and types.
