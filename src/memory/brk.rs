/// A `Result` containing the new program break address as a `usize`. Note that
/// according to the `brk(2)` man page, the syscall itself doesn't "fail" in the
/// traditional sense. It always returns a memory address, hence the Infallible
/// error type.
/// - If `addr` is 0, it returns the current break.
/// - On a successful resize, it returns the new break.
/// - On a failed resize, it returns the current, unchanged break.
