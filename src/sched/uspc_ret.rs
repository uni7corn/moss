/// Prepares the kernel for a safe return to userspace, guaranteeing a valid
/// context frame is prepared.
///
/// This function is the primary gateway for transitioning from a kernel context
/// (e.g., after a syscall, interrupt, or fault) back to userspace code. It
/// ensures a task is in a valid state to resume execution, handling any
/// necessary kernel business before the final context restore.
///
/// The core of this function is a loop that guarantees progress. It will always
/// find a runnable task and prepare its context for userspace return, even if
/// the initial task needs to be terminated, put to sleep, or handle a signal
/// first.
///
/// The logical flow inside the loop for a chosen task is as follows:
///
/// 1. Schedule: A task is selected to run next. This may trigger a context
///    switch if the scheduler picks a different task than the one that entered
///    the kernel.
/// 2. Poll In-Flight Work: It checks for and polls any outstanding asynchronous
///    work associated with the task, such as signal delivery (`signal_work`) or
///    another kernel future (`kern_work`).
///     - If the work is `Poll::Pending`, the task is put to sleep, and the loop
///       continues to find another task.
///     - If the work completes successfully (`Poll::Ready(Ok(_))`), the
///       function proceeds.
///     - If signal delivery fails (`Poll::Ready(Err(_))`), it's a fatal error,
///       and the task is terminated. The loop continues to find another task.
/// 3. Action New Signals: If there is no in-flight work, it checks for any new
///    pending signals. Depending on the signal's disposition, the task may be
///    terminated or new `signal_work` may be queued. If new work is queued, the
///    loop restarts to process it immediately.
/// 4. Final Return: If a task has no pending work and no new signals to action,
///    its userspace context is restored into the `ctx` pointer, the current
///    address space is guaranteed to be active, and the function returns.
///
/// # Parameters
/// - `ctx`: A mutable pointer to the stack-allocated `UserCtx` (the exception
///   frame). This function will write the register context of the task being
///   returned to into this location, making it ready for the
///   architecture-specific return-to-userspace instructions.
///
/// # Guarantees
/// - This function will always return; it does not diverge (unless it panics).
/// - Upon return, the address space of the task being resumed will be active.
/// - Upon return, the memory pointed to by `ctx` will be populated with the
///   valid userspace register state for that task.
///
/// # Panics
/// This function will panic if it detects an attempt to process signals or
/// kernel work for the special idle task, as this indicates a critical bug in
/// the scheduler or task management.
